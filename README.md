## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the MedMitra project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js**: LTS version (e.g., 18.x or 20.x). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm** or **yarn**: Package managers for Node.js (usually installed with Node.js).
* **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **pip**: Python package installer (comes with Python).
* **Supabase Project**:
    * Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    * Obtain your `Project URL` and `Service Role Key` (found under Project Settings -> API).
    * You will also need the `Anon Key` for the frontend.
* **Groq API Key**:
    * Sign up and get your API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
* **LlamaParse API Key**:
    * Sign up and get your API key from [Llama Cloud](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/).

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd spyrosigma-medmitra/backend
    ```

2.  **Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend/` directory (at the same level as `app.py`) and add your environment variables:

    ```ini
    SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
    LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY="YOUR_LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY"
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
    # WEAVIATE_API_KEY="YOUR_WEAVIATE_API_KEY" # Uncomment and set if Weaviate is integrated
    # WEAVIATE_REST_URL="YOUR_WEAVIATE_REST_URL" # Uncomment and set if Weaviate is integrated
    ```
    *Replace placeholders with your actual keys and URLs.*

5.  **Run the backend application:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
    The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd spyrosigma-medmitra/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # Or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env.local` file** in the `frontend/` directory (at the same level as `package.json`) and add your environment variables for Supabase client-side and backend API URL:

    ```ini
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL="http://localhost:8000" # Use your deployed backend URL if applicable
    ```
    *Replace placeholders with your actual Supabase URL and Anon Key. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL` should point to where your FastAPI backend is running.*

4.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # Or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  You will be prompted to sign up or log in. Use the authentication flow to create an account or access an existing one.
3.  Once logged in, navigate to the dashboard where you can view and manage patient cases.
4.  To create a new case, click on the "New Case" button. You can then fill in patient details and upload relevant medical documents (PDF lab reports, radiology images).
5.  After uploading, the system will automatically process the documents using the AI agents. The generated medical insights, including case summaries, SOAP notes, and diagnoses, will be displayed within the case details.
